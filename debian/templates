Description: Initialize the PostgreSQL database for Vaulthalla?
 Vaulthalla requires a PostgreSQL database to function. Selecting "Yes" will automatically create the
 database and user with a secure, randomly generated password.
 .
 If you select "No", you must manually create the required database and user. Vaulthalla will not
 function without this step, and support is not provided for manual setup issues via GitHub Issues.
