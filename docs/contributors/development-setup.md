# Development Setup

This guide is for contributors getting from clone to useful local work.

If you are doing docs-only work, you do not need the full Linux runtime environment. If you are touching core runtime, FUSE, packaging, systemd, PostgreSQL, TPM/swtpm, or install lifecycle behavior, you do.

## Platform Assumptions

Vaulthalla is Linux-native software.

Meaningful validation for these areas requires a Linux environment:

- core daemon work
- FUSE behavior
- package lifecycle scripts
- systemd services
- PostgreSQL bootstrap and state handling
- TPM or `swtpm` integration

Debian and Ubuntu-style environments are the safest contributor path because the repo scripts and package metadata assume `apt`, `sudo`, systemd, and Debian packaging.

If you are on macOS or Windows, docs work is fine, and some web or release-tooling work may still be possible. Do not pretend that means you fully validated Linux runtime behavior.

## Quick Health Check

From the repo root:

```bash
bash .codex/scripts/doctor.sh
bash .codex/scripts/index.sh
```

`doctor.sh` checks for `git`, `python3`, `node`, `pnpm`, `meson`, `ninja`, the presence of `web/node_modules`, and the top-level project files the repo expects.

## Toolchains

### Streamlined local install via `Makefile`

If you want the repo's higher-level entrypoints instead of driving the scripts manually, the top-level [`Makefile`](../../Makefile) is the streamlined route.

Common targets:

```bash
make install
make dev
make test
make run_test
make clean_test
make clean
```

What they do at a high level:

- `make install` runs the normal install guard, then `./bin/install.sh`
- `make dev` runs `./bin/uninstall.sh`, then the install guard, then `./bin/install.sh`
- `make test` and `make run_test` rebuild the integration-test environment through `bin/tests/*`

Use these deliberately. They are host-mutating install workflows, not lightweight build aliases.

### Web/admin work

The web client uses:

- Node pinned by `web/.nvmrc` (`24.13`)
- `pnpm`
- Next.js, React, TypeScript, ESLint

Setup:

```bash
cd web
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm test
pnpm dev
```

### Release-tooling work

The release tooling uses Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

Setup:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m tools.release check
```

### Core/runtime work

For Linux contributors on a machine or VM you are comfortable modifying, the repo provides an install-deps helper:

```bash
./bin/setup/install_deps.sh
```

That script adds the Vaulthalla APT repository if needed and installs native dependencies such as Meson, Ninja, PostgreSQL, FUSE, PDFium, `libpqxx`, `libsodium`, `libtss2`, `swtpm`, and related packages.

Run it deliberately. It changes the host.

## Preferred Dev Workflow

The fastest rebuild-and-reinstall loop in this repo is the destructive dev workflow behind `make dev`.

It is fast because it starts from a fresh local install every time.

It is dangerous because `make dev` begins by running `./bin/uninstall.sh`, which can wipe Vaulthalla directories and local database state with no interactive warning path once dev mode is active.

### Dev mode guardrails

The repo requires two guardrails before the destructive dev workflow is considered valid:

1. set `VH_BUILD_MODE=dev`
2. create a repo-root sentinel file named `enable_dev_mode` whose contents are exactly `true`

Example:

```bash
export VH_BUILD_MODE=dev
printf 'true\n' > enable_dev_mode
make dev
```

This behavior is enforced by `bin/lib/dev_mode.sh`. If `VH_BUILD_MODE=dev` is set without the sentinel, the scripts fail. If the sentinel exists but `VH_BUILD_MODE` is not `dev`, the scripts warn about the mismatch.

If you use this workflow, do it on a machine or VM where destroying the local Vaulthalla install is acceptable.

### Custom install path

If you want the same install plumbing without using the `Makefile`, the equivalent lower-level path is:

```bash
./bin/install.sh
```

For destructive dev-mode reinstall behavior, the `Makefile` target is just wrapping:

```bash
./bin/uninstall.sh
./bin/install.sh
```

## Core Build Path

The current CI-style core build path is Meson-based:

```bash
meson setup build --buildtype=debug -Dbuild_unit_tests=true -Dinstall_data=false
meson compile -C build
meson test -C build
```

That matches the shape used in `.github/actions/build/action.yml` and `.github/actions/test/action.yml`.

The repo root is the Meson project root. `core/` remains the C++ subsystem, and `compile_commands.json` is emitted at `build/compile_commands.json`.

If your work needs an installed runtime rather than just a compiled binary, the repository also provides higher-level install and test helpers under `bin/` and `core/bin/`.

## Integration And Runtime Test Path

For Linux-only runtime validation:

```bash
./bin/tests/install.sh --run
./bin/tests/uninstall.sh
```

What that setup path does:

- installs native dependencies
- prepares users and directories
- prepares PostgreSQL state
- builds the core integration target
- runs the integration binary when `--run` is provided

This path depends on `sudo`, Linux, FUSE, PostgreSQL, and other host-level pieces. Use it when your change affects runtime behavior rather than simple docs or web copy.

### Test database requirements

For the integration test path and some DB-backed unit tests, you need the test database variables to resolve to the expected test database:

```bash
VH_TEST_DB_USER=vaulthalla_test
VH_TEST_DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
VH_TEST_DB_PORT=5432
VH_TEST_DB_NAME=vh_cli_test
```

Current script behavior matters here:

- the database name is hard-coded in the test setup scripts as `vh_cli_test`
- the role is hard-coded as `vaulthalla_test`
- `bin/tests/install_db.sh` generates `VH_TEST_DB_PASS` automatically during test-environment setup

You should not assume the password is static. The current scripts generate it as part of the test setup flow.

## Local Config And Environment Notes

- Default runtime config ships from `deploy/config/config.yaml`.
- Install scripts copy config into `/etc/vaulthalla/config.yaml`.
- The web service unit uses `deploy/systemd/vaulthalla-web.service.in`.
- Some local scripts look for `deploy/vaulthalla.env`.

The repo only ships `deploy/vaulthalla.env.example` as a public template. If you need real storage-backed test credentials or environment values, create your own local `deploy/vaulthalla.env` from that template and keep secrets out of commits.

### R2/S3 test environment

If you want the dev workflow to carry R2 test credentials into the installed environment:

1. copy `deploy/vaulthalla.env.example` to `deploy/vaulthalla.env`
2. uncomment and fill in the `VAULTHALLA_TEST_R2_*` variables

The example variables are:

```text
# VAULTHALLA_TEST_R2_ACCESS_KEY=<your_access_key>
# VAULTHALLA_TEST_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_key>
# VAULTHALLA_TEST_R2_ENDPOINT=https://<your_unique_id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
# VAULTHALLA_TEST_R2_REGION=auto
# VAULTHALLA_TEST_R2_BUCKET=<your_bucket_name>
```

When `deploy/vaulthalla.env` exists, `bin/setup/install_dirs.sh` installs it as `/etc/vaulthalla/vaulthalla.env`.

### Optional dev R2 test vault seeding

`deploy/config/config.yaml` includes:

```yaml
dev:
  enabled: false
  init_r2_test_vault: false
```

If dev mode is enabled in config and `init_r2_test_vault` is set to `true`, the storage manager can seed an `R2 Test Vault` automatically during startup when the required `VAULTHALLA_TEST_R2_*` environment variables are present.

Keep this workflow-specific and local. Do not commit real credentials.

## Known Practical Snags

### Missing `web/node_modules`

`bash .codex/scripts/doctor.sh` will flag this. Run:

```bash
cd web
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

### Web build failures caused by missing private icons

The CI web build syncs private icons from `~/vaulthalla-web-icons` before `pnpm build`. If local web build work depends on those assets, coordinate with the maintainer instead of committing fake replacements.

### Integration test scripts expecting `deploy/vaulthalla.env`

Some scripts reference `deploy/vaulthalla.env`, while the repo only includes `deploy/vaulthalla.env.example`. If your test path needs environment values, create the local file explicitly.

### `make dev` is not a safe default

It is a rebuild convenience for contributors who intentionally want a fresh local install every time. It is not a normal "development server" command and it is not safe on a machine whose Vaulthalla state you care about keeping.

### Cross-platform false confidence

If you changed FUSE, packaging, auth/session, systemd, PostgreSQL lifecycle, or TPM behavior from a non-Linux machine, your local check is not enough. Say that plainly in the PR and ask for the right Linux validation.
