Description: Self-hosted cloud platform with native FUSE and S3 sync
 Vaulthalla is a modern self-hosted cloud storage platform designed as
 a high-performance alternative to Nextcloud. It features a C++ core
 daemon, native Linux filesystem via FUSE, S3-compatible object storage,
 PostgreSQL indexing, and a secure web frontend. Vaulthalla emphasizes
 speed, sovereignty, and deep system integration for power users.
